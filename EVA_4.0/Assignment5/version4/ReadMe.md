**Target:**

Add GAP layer. Add more layer at the end. 

**Result:**
Parameters: 11.9k
Best Train Accuracy: 99.33
Best Test Accuracy: 99.23

**Analysis:**
The model still showing over-fitting, Adding it to a specific layer wasn't a great idea. 
Quite Possibly we need to add more capacity, especially at the end. 
We can also increase the capacity of the model by adding a layer after GAP!
